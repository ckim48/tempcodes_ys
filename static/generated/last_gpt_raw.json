  "title": "Ethics in Intelligence During Conflict",
  "intro": "The Falklands War, fought between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982, serves as a significant case study in military ethics, particularly for intelligence officers. In this conflict, intelligence played a crucial role in shaping strategies and decisions. As an intelligence officer, you are tasked with gathering and analyzing information to support military operations while also considering the ethical implications of your actions. The presence of civilians in the conflict zone adds an additional layer of complexity, as their safety must be prioritized alongside military objectives. This scenario will guide you through a series of decisions that highlight the importance of ethical considerations in warfare, especially in the context of protecting non-combatants and adhering to international humanitarian law.",
